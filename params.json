This September she started an internship and is working with the IT Team of Cylix Technologies, Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\nDay 1: ERPnext and Frappe\r\n------------------------------\r\n*Sept 26, 2016*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI have started my internship at Cylix Technologies, Inc. Cylix Technologies is one of the market leaders, as well as one of the fastest growing companies in the **Security and Surveillance Technology Industry** in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nI have been assigned an email address: [gaby.di@cylix.ph]() which I can login to at [http://webmail.cylix.ph](). I was also granted access to the company's intranet and WordPress. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent my first 3 hours learning about **ERPnext and Frappe**.\r\n\r\n* **ERPNext** is a free and open-source integrated **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)** software for the web developed by *Frappé Technologies Pvt. Ltd.* and is built on **MariaDB** database system using a **Python** based server-side framework. \r\n\r\n* **Frappé**  is the Rapid Application Development Framework in Python & JS used to build ERPNext.\r\n\r\n### How to install ERPnext\r\n\r\nTo run ERPnext I had to download **Oracle's VirtualBox** in order to run Ubuntu Linux on a virtual machine which now lives inside my laptop.\r\n\r\n* [virtualbox.com]() \r\n\r\nI then mounted the ERPnext iso image file into the virtual machine.\r\n\r\nWhen VirtualBox Boots, login using user: frappe and password: frappe\r\n\r\nAfterwards, input the followings command in order to start Frappe Bench. Without this step the host site will not launch.\r\n\r\n\tcd frappe-bench\r\n\tbench start\r\n\r\nThen, on the HOST machine (mine is Windows 10), use the browser and go to:\r\n\r\n*[ http://localhost 8080]()\r\n\r\nand login using:\r\n\r\n* user: Administrator\r\n* password: admin\r\n\r\n### I learned a few new commands today:**\r\n\r\n\tifconfig | grep HWaddr --> Linux, specifically returns MAC address\r\n\r\n\tipconfig --> Windows\r\n\r\n\tping google.com --> to check there is an active internet connection\r\n\tping facebook.com\r\n\r\n\tCtrl + C --> to exit a particular command in terminal/cmdline",
